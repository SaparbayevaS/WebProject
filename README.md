# WebProject

The project is a web application for movie lovers. The platform allows users to browse a list of movies with posters, descriptions, genres, and ratings. Additionally, users can like movies and add them to their favourites list for quick access later. The application may also include a recommendation feature based on liked movies. 
Our goal is to create a simple and user-friendly platform where users can discover new movies and keep track of their favourites.
